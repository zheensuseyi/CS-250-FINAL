// How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

When this project started, we did a user interview for the SNHU Travel website where they voiced their wants and needs with the website. These interviews were great because it gave everyone a nudge in the right direction when working on the SNHU Travel Website. The way we implementing the user needs was by putting the requests on a product backlog and prioritizing them from most to least important. 

// How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing programs is a team effort and making sure the team is happy and given enough time, anything can be done. An agile process I think really helps out is daily Scrum, its basically a daily short meeting in which the Scrum Master gets everyone back on track and where the rest of the team can voice their opinion on the project. In the future, I hope to be a developer on a team and I would look forward to these meetings in order to remember whats important and to be on track. 

// What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member goes hand-in-hand with being a good human being. A good human being is polite and listens to others while not being selfish or dishonest. A good team member in software development is very similar. It doesn't matter how good of a programmer you are if you are a terrible person to others, I am sure the majority of people would rather have someone who isn't as good in their role who is nice and lifts the morale of everyone then a bad human being. My personal goal is to be a great programmer and to be a nice and polite person to anyone I work with.
